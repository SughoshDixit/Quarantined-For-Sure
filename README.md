# Quarantined-For-Sure
Problem

Covid-19 is a highly contagious virus which can spread easily. In Bengaluru people who returned from foreign countries are stamped with a blue ink seal which says "quarantined for 14 days". But its already too late if the person goes out and he/she could infect potentially hundred others. So, we want to make tracking of thousands of people who are already under quarantine and who will be in quarantine easier and prevent further spread of this epidemic also prevent another wave of this epidemic. 

Solution
 
QuarantineForSure (QFS) is a mobile app which will be able to keep track of the people who are under strictly imposed home quarantine. Using maps API, a polygon will be drawn as a boundary and when the person leaves the boundary an alert to the cops and nearby residents will be sent with their location. The phone will be connected to a 3D printed wristband with Bluetooth and the person should maintain 15m distance with the phone also it has a sensor which restricts taking it off so tracking is ensured.
